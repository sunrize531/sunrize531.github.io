Title: About this site and myself

Summary: Short disclaimer and little information about the author

# Hi there, thanks for coming

This site is basically a public notepad with tags. I'm gonna store here the things i can't make into modules,
but keep doing over and over again in my everyday programming tasks. I also keep some pattern-like scribles
and ideas on repl.it, but it's not always convinient. Also thought I might as well share.

Will see how it goes, most likely this thing is going to die eventually just like all of my previous 
attempts to go public. I don't even care that much, though...

## Little about myself

Name's Ivan Filimonov, I'm from Ukraine, live and work in the UK. Javascript and Python programmer,
mostly do server things. Work quite a lot with mongo too, think I probably figured it out decently. Some AWS stuff,
of course. Quite like doing client as well, but it's now all React, and I'm not too excited about React.
Getting old here lol. Yeah, 39 years old. Used to work in game industry, but not at the moment.
Love music, walking, cycling, taking pictures and have few pints from time to time.
