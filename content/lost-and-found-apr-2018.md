Summary: Useful-ish things found in April
Tags: node, webpack, cors, collections

### Amazon supports Node 8 in lambda functions

[Pretty much it - can use `async` syntax sugar and all that](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/node-js-8-10-runtime-now-available-in-aws-lambda/)

### You can proxy someone's API CORS using just webpack config

[Might be useful when you do a client for 3rd party API, need to call it from localhost, and API won't let you](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserver-proxy)

### Some reasoning on using ES6 Maps

[Other collections types like Set, WeakMap and WeakSet don't really need reasoning](https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-collections-map-set-weakmap-weakset/)

### Regex for user input sanitisation (Cross Site Scripting and MySQL injecting)

[Even if we don't use SQL at all, still don't won't this shit comming through](https://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/detection-sql-injection-and-cross-site-scripting-attacks)
